## Laravel News Links

Welcome to the Laravel News Links Repository. This code is designed to power [links.laravel-news.com](http://links.laravel-news.com) and it's goal is to allow people to submit news, packages, and tutorials to the site. 

The project has the following goals: 

* [x] Login/Register
* [x] Once signed in add a new link
* [x] The link is then placed into holding and an email sent to administrator for approval. 
* [ ] Admin logins and approves or denies. (_If approved email the user and tell them_)
* [x] A paged list of links sorted by published date. 
* [ ] A simple API that will grab x number of links for display on the main Laravel News site.
* [ ] An admin view that generates a list of links that has been submitted since last Sunday. This will be used for the newsletter. 
* [ ] The ability for signed in users to favorite a link which is basically a bookmark that they can later see on their profile. 
* [ ] Ability for users to edit their links later. 

Ideally my goal is to make this app as simple as possible, so anyone familiar with Laravel can follow all the code and it all make sense.
